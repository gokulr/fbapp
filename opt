I would like to take this essay to address my undergraduate GPA of 3.29/5. As much as I am disappointed with not having stellar grades, which is largely because of lapse on my part, I would like to deal with the situation head-on, own up to my slipups and hopefully demonstrate a side that is not reflected by GPA.
Throughout my high-school years, I was among the top achievers, regularly winning national and regional level mathematics contests. Having scored 100% in A-level mathematics, I positioned myself among top 0.1% students in India. Additionally, an aggregate of 94.2% among other core courses in A-levels earned me the SIA-NOL scholarship, which fully sponsored my undergraduate education at NUS.
At NUS, I was particularly drawn towards courses that were project-oriented, hands-on and collaborative. This “getting-things-done” mindset of mine landed me a number of internships, including a unique research opportunity at ETH Zurich. I was the first student from NUS to receive such an offer. My research work, in collaboration with PhDs at ETH was highly lauded and it earned me a research grant from The Swiss National Science Foundation. The research also gained the attention of, The Dean, NUS School of Computing, who conferred me to further the project under his supervision as part of my bachelor’s dissertation.
At Citi, I was promoted twice in the last three years and have quickly grown from fresh-out-of-college graduate to the technical lead of the Singapore team. Outside my professional engagement, I have been an active leader and campaigner for various programs at Citi such as vertical marathons, charity runs, and cancer awareness campaigns, showing strong commitment to my community.
