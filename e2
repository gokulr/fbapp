- add stuff about ur current skills and the skill that would be acquired from teper mba
- always been at the back end of things with doing analytics and helping product management, marketing, sales 
- my past experience has convinced me that this would be the correct carer oath for me. would like to be in the forefront of things now, that is manage and market new products.. and with Tepper's strong blah blah blah,

I sincerely believe that Tepper's extensive academic rigour and strong alumni network that are spread across will help me in journey to realize my short term goals.
= have had seniors who did this in the past.. with tepper.. this motivates me

"Our students’ ability to approach marketplace and consumer issues as part of a honed, analytical framework is rare – and valued – in today’s fast-paced industries and categories. Within an analytical decision-making context, coursework encompasses product marketing, market entry planning, marketing with social media, segmentation, communications management, pricing/sales forecasting, channel distribution and management and marketing research."


"your strong passion for learning and your desire to expand your role as an innovative leader. Get those points across to the adcom members and you could be well on your way to the tech-savvy business education that only Tepper can provide."

Given my background as a wine journalist, I am well aware of the traditional aspects of the wine-making
industry and recognize that many vintners are slow to adapt to modern manufacturing and marketing
techniques. With my MBA from Shinewald University, I will have the specific entrepreneurial and operational
skills necessary to develop a small vineyard and nurture it so that it realizes its full potential. I see myself in
my first position after earning my MBA as the general manager of an antiquated vineyard in the ABC region,
implementing operational efficiencies, accessing capital for growth and marketing a superior product nationally
and even internationally.


While I strongly believe that - Tepper's emphasis on analytics & leadership along with concentration tracks such as "Technology Leadership" and "Management of Innovation & Product Development" and a strong successful alumni network that had shared and realized dreams similar to that of mine - will help me in my journey to achieve my dream, one cannot deny the uncertainties presented by life :) It is one of the many things that keeps our lives and aspirations alive and fascinating!
If plan A doesn't materialize, I yearn to become a Product Marketer/Strategist in a FMCG firm. This would not only help me keep up my goals to shoulder an impact on wider consumer base, but also help me assimilate valuable knowledge on consumer behaviour, product strategy and product marketing - skills that I can transfer to my plan A should an opportunity arise.

The first time I heard about Tepper was in 2011 from a friend named Santosh Bhavani, who did his BS and PhD from CMU. We met each other in Switzerland during our undergraduate exchange program at ETH Zurich. What really struck me was how passionately he spoke of the collaborative student community in CMU and the vast pool of resources that the school had to offer him to pursue his research in Computational Biology. 
My second interaction was with Nikita Kumar, a 2nd year MBA student currently at Tepper. Nikita is also a friend and an ex-teammate of mine here at Citi. I have had the opportunity to learn firsthand from her about the student experience in Tepper and the various clubs one could be a part of. She emphasized the importance of small size of the program and how it helped her with networking, leadership and contribute qualitatively to the learning experience at CMU
Having had the distinctly remember
If there is one thing that I have taken away from all these interactions, it is this place has given a wonderful platform from students to realize their dreams. 
Talk about the courses, the analytics tracks, 
However all these are not one way street.. you have to contribyte back.. corny, but u are what u make of it.. what u give.. it is what u make of it.. its not a complete experience if we don’t give back..
I ll provide my unique perspective on things.. drawn on from various experiences of working/studying/leading internationally.. contribute to club a,b and c.. hoping to do this that etc.. like how things are all student driven in tepper and it gives me a chance to contribute to the society.. talk about how one club is close to ur heart and how u will totally contribute to it and go head over heals..

The strong core of business knowledge at Tepper would help develop a comprehensive understanding of business. Tepper’s emphasis on Analytics gives me confidence regarding its relevance to my goals. Tepper’s Analytics Tracks concentrations in Finance, Operations Research and Management & Strategy would significantly contribute to my specific industry knowledge. The mini semester system makes it easy to gain an understanding of varied business fields. The opportunities to work on innovative projects would apprise me of the real world challenges of multidimensional and complex issues managers face today in both large and mid-size firms.
The small size of the program would facilitate networking, mentoring and leadership training. The school’s focus on developing leaders and communications would strengthen my ability. Exposure to career verticals, grounding in communication, ethics and organizational behavior and exposure to diversity in the form of ideas, mindsets and cultural nuances would make me flexible in my thinking. 
Tepper’s encouragement of women, evident from initiatives such as Tepper Women in Business and the Forte Foundation, resonates with my work with the Women in Technology Initiative at Citi. The school’s strong ties with financial and technology firms would help me access the opportunities I seek post-MBA.
