Despite having a good academic track record during the formative period of my school life, my undergraduate GPA of 3.29/5 fell short of my own standards. As much as I am disappointed about having a lazy start to college, I would like to deal with the situation head-on, own up to my mistakes and hopefully demonstrate the skills I have picked along the way to overcome these shortcomings.
Academically, I have been a high achiever throughout high school and junior college winning several national and regional level mathematics contests. Having scored 100% in A-level mathematics exam, I positioned myself among top 0.1% students in India. Besides faring well in math, I had scored an aggregate of 94.2% among all core subjects in A-levels and this helped me get the SIA-NOL undergraduate scholarship, which fully sponsored for my undergraduate education at NUS.
At NUS, I have consistently done well in courses that were project-oriented, hands-on and collaborative. This “getting-things-done” mindset of mine helped me land a number of internships, including a unique research opportunity in ETH Zurich. Being the first NUS student to have been accepted into such a program, my research work and collaboration with the PhDs at ETH was met with great enthusiasm and it helped me secure a research grant from Swiss National Science Foundation. The research also gained the attention of Dean, NUS School of Computing, who granted me to further my research as bachelor thesis under his supervision.
At Citi, I have been one of the top performers in the team and have shown constant commitment, leadership and technical expertise. This led me get promoted twice in the last three years and helped me to grow quickly to become the technical lead of the team in Singapore.
