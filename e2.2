The first time I heard about Tepper was in 2011 from a friend named Santosh Bhavani (who I met in ETH Zurich during our exchange program), who completed his BS and PhD from CMU. It really struck me how passionately he spoke of the collaborative student community in CMU and the vast pool of resources that the school had to offer him to pursue his research. That was my first impression of CMU.
My second interaction was with Nikita Kumar, an ex-teammate at Citi and a 2nd year Tepper MBA student. I have had the opportunity to learn firsthand from Nikita about the various student experiences at Tepper. She stressed on how the Tepper culture, its close-knit community and the small size of the program had all stood out from her other choices and it truly enhanced her learning experience. She delineated on the Accelerated Leadership Center at Tepper and how it helped her hone her communication and leadership skills. The rigorous curriculum, variety of concentrations that are offered on a mini semester basis had all helped her gain a wider business perspective and helped become a well-rounded business professional.
These conversations not only gave me clarity on what I would gain out of Tepper but also reassured me of the fact that Tepper has been a place where students, like me, have been able to share and realize dreams.
Tech strategy course,, the  email with the chat with prospective student etc…
and the various clubs one could be a part of
Having had the distinctly remember
made a great impact on, fruitful, enriched
Talk about the courses, the analytics tracks, 
However all these are not one way street.. you have to contribute back.. corny, but u are what u make of it.. what u give.. it is what u make of it.. its not a complete experience if we don’t give back..
I ll provide my unique perspective on things.. drawn on from various experiences of working/studying/leading internationally.. contribute to club a, b and c.. hoping to do this that etc.. like how things are all student driven in Tepper and it gives me a chance to contribute to the society.. talk about how one club is close to ur heart and how u will totally contribute to it and go head over heals..
My Indian upbringing and value system, college education in Singapore, keen analytical abilities, a love for learning, ambition and a strong desire to make a difference would help me add a unique dimension to class discussions. 
I hope to share my understanding of organizational behaviour, and the challenges of doing business in the Asian markets. Having a fair understanding of differences between Asian exchanges as well as the current and growing scope of predictive analytics especially in the financial sector, I will be able to add a different perspective for case studies and discussions. Having travelled extensively, I have an understanding of diversity. 
Through my life, I have tried to add to the environment/ community I am a part of. At university, I conceptualized a French Fair to attract more staff and students interested in francophone culture. At work, I have organized informal team bonding events as simple as coffee on a weekday, dinner on Friday evening but each of these has strengthened team dynamics. I facilitate team interactions and am able to synthesize opinions to develop a solution. At Citi, I regularly sign up for CSR events. I have been a volunteer of the Global Community Day, been a member of WIN for attracting and retaining female talent and helped in a cause for under privileged kids held in partnership with YMCA. The technology markets in Asia are still dominated by men. To bring more women into this field, I initiated the idea of seminars to introduce female students at NTU to both technical and non-technical roles in technology. 
My understanding of the culture, mind-set and priorities of women would help my peers understand realities better. As an alumna, I hope to help students at Tepper build connections and uncover business opportunities within my domain - just like I have been doing for NTU.
********************************
The strong core of business knowledge at Tepper would help develop a comprehensive understanding of business. Tepper’s emphasis on Analytics gives me confidence regarding its relevance to my goals. Tepper’s Analytics Tracks concentrations in Finance, Operations Research and Management & Strategy would significantly contribute to my specific industry knowledge. The mini semester system makes it easy to gain an understanding of varied business fields. The opportunities to work on innovative projects would apprise me of the real world challenges of multidimensional and complex issues managers face today in both large and mid-size firms.
The small size of the program would facilitate networking, mentoring and leadership training. The school’s focus on developing leaders and communications would strengthen my ability. Exposure to career verticals, grounding in communication, ethics and organizational behavior and exposure to diversity in the form of ideas, mindsets and cultural nuances would make me flexible in my thinking. 
Tepper’s encouragement of women, evident from initiatives such as Tepper Women in Business and the Forte Foundation, resonates with my work with the Women in Technology Initiative at Citi. The school’s strong ties with financial and technology firms would help me access the opportunities I seek post-MBA.
