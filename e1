Here is an example of how you might leverage the five components to create your own, unique outline. You could lead with your short-term goal to transition from consulting into non-profit strategy (The Future). Then you might give us some of the backstory: What you’ve done in the past (work or personal experiences) and how that led you to be extremely passionate about the non-profit world (The Past). Next you might talk about how an MBA from Wharton will enrich you on a personal and professional level such that you’ll be uniquely prepared to take on future challenges (Why an MBA?). Finally you might circle back to your future vision and paint a picture of where you hope to be in 10-15 years time (The Future).

A friend of mine recently equated getting an MBA to getting yourself a pet monkey - expensive, difficult and you have got to be 100% sure that you need it. While that was a pretty funny analogy, I think a better one would be . It is everything a pet monkey is but done at the right place can be incredibly rewarding. 

#5: “The easiest thing is to react. The second easiest is to respond. But the hardest thing is to initiate.”

2. “Your turn. Imagine that the world had no middlemen, no publishers, no bosses, no HR folks, no one telling you what you couldn’t do. If you lived in that world, what would you do? Go do that.”

3) "If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try." 

“The secret of leadership is simple: Do what you believe in. Paint a picture of the future. Go there.
People will follow.”

“Leadership, on the other hand, is about creating change you believe in.”

Outside my professional engagement, I catch up with Gokul from time to time to discuss his career and his personal life.  During one of the engagements, Gokul showed a shade of pessimism on the frequency of leadership changes in his group. Gokul was right; his group had multiple leaders within a very short period of time. 
I explained to Gokul that the frequency was also undesirable to me since a leader or a manager needs to have a few strong years with the team to understand, coach and build the team. 
Since he was directly impacted, I asked him to keep his focus on long term objectives and also spend time to understand different product building strategies during the period. For instance, I encouraged him to pick up “Zero to One” by Peter Thiel to understand how the Valley builds product which Gokul did. He relished the context provided by Thiel on building products during my conversations. I normally have conversations now with him on long term objectives and how to achieve them.
