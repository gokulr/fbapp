There comes a time in everyone's life, a moment, an experience, that just shakes things up for them; gives them that much needed whack on the head; a different perspective. Some are lucky enough to have them come at the right time. Here is my story.
Every year, the month of January proves to be an interesting time for people in Citi. For some, it gives them a reason to be proud and happy. While for others, it proves to be tricky, emotional and gives a lot to reflect on: Promotions and Appraisals. My 2015 January was not off to a great start. After what I thought of as a successful 2014 -a year when I took on increased responsibilities, frequently ventured out of my comfort zone to pick new skills- I couldn't take the news of no promotion all that well. Thanks to my slightly below-average maturity at that time and the immediate loss of my then manager to another firm. In what seemed like an all-time low in my relatively short career, I lost all my motivation and felt that I had no one to prove myself to. Disenchantment and self-pitying mode was on.
Fast-forwarding to July 4th 2015. Those six hours that I spent that night, running and crawling, trying to finish my first ever full-marathon, had a profound impact in the way I looked at my career. Those six hours gave me reasons worthy enough to keep delivering; keep shipping my work. I had to do it because that is what I love doing. Sure I may not reach my destination at the same pace as everyone else, but I needed to keep taking that next step to get there. I expected everything to be handed over to me in my career, but I realized that it was all in my hands. I needed to carry on and the destiny was bound to arrive. Sure enough, I got there. I got that promotion in September, and more importantly an opportunity to manage my team; an opportunity to respond instead of react.
