Here is an example of how you might leverage the five components to create your own, unique outline. You could lead with your short-term goal to transition from consulting into non-profit strategy (The Future). Then you might give us some of the backstory: What you’ve done in the past (work or personal experiences) and how that led you to be extremely passionate about the non-profit world (The Past). Next you might talk about how an MBA from Wharton will enrich you on a personal and professional level such that you’ll be uniquely prepared to take on future challenges (Why an MBA?). Finally you might circle back to your future vision and paint a picture of where you hope to be in 10-15 years time (The Future).

Knowing that I was applying for MBA, a friend of mine came to me and said "Bro, getting an MBA is like getting yourself a pet monkey - it is difficult, it is expensive and above all you have got to have a really good reason to get yourself one". Little inappropriate I thought, but there was truth in that :)



#5: “The easiest thing is to react. The second easiest is to respond. But the hardest thing is to initiate.”
2. “Your turn. Imagine that the world had no middlemen, no publishers, no bosses, no HR folks, no one telling you what you couldn’t do. If you lived in that world, what would you do? Go do that.”
3) "If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try." 

“The secret of leadership is simple: Do what you believe in. Paint a picture of the future. Go there.
People will follow.”

“Leadership, on the other hand, is about creating change you believe in.”

Outside my professional engagement, I catch up with Gokul from time to time to discuss his career and his personal life.  During one of the engagements, Gokul showed a shade of pessimism on the frequency of leadership changes in his group. Gokul was right; his group had multiple leaders within a very short period of time. 
I explained to Gokul that the frequency was also undesirable to me since a leader or a manager needs to have a few strong years with the team to understand, coach and build the team. 
Since he was directly impacted, I asked him to keep his focus on long term objectives and also spend time to understand different product building strategies during the period. For instance, I encouraged him to pick up “Zero to One” by Peter Thiel to understand how the Valley builds product which Gokul did. He relished the context provided by Thiel on building products during my conversations. I normally have conversations now with him on long term objectives and how to achieve them.

Despite having a good academic track record during the formative period of my school life, be it in high school, junior college (A-levels) or national level talent exams, my undergraduate GPA of 3.29/5 definitely fell short of my own standards.
I expect this hitch to have an impact in my candidacy and it is absolutely understandable. As much as I am disappointed about it, I would like to deal with the situation with candor, own up to my mistakes and hopefully demonstrate the skills I have picked up along the way to overcome these shortcomings. 
Academically, I have always been a high achiever throughout high school and junior college. I have taken part and won several national and regional level Mathematics talent exams. I had scored a 100% in my mathematics exams in A-levels, resulting in positioning myself among the top 0.1% to achieve that in India. I had also received a Certificate of Merit from Government of India acknowledging this feat. Besides doing well in math, I had scored an aggregate of 94.2% among all subjects in A-levels, and this helped me get one of the coveted undergraduate scholarships offered to Indian students - SIA-NOL that fully sponsored for my undergraduate education at NUS.
At NUS, I have always done well at courses that were project oriented, hands-on and collaborative. This attribute of mine helped me get the backing of the then-Dean, School of Computing, NUS in my application for a research internship in ETH Zurich. The research project not only helped me get a grant from Swiss National Science Foundation, but also helped me get an offer to do my bachelor thesis with the Dean of NUS School of computing.
At Citi, I have been one of the strong contributors in the team and have shown constant commitment, leadership and technical expertise. This had led to me get promoted twice in the last three years and eventually be the technical lead of the team in Singapore.
